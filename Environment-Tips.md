# Executor Environment Tips

For your executor, people expect reliable functions and a stable environment, whether external or internal. There are several principles you should follow to ensure your functions work properly and are well-implemented. This is not to say that a function will automatically be bad if it is written in LuaU, but here are some tips for improving the stability of your functions.

# 1. Type-Checking
- Your environmental functions should have proper type-checking implemented, this is to prevent any type of errors or misconceptions or worst case a crash when passing something through the parameters of a function.

# 2. Function Naming
- Double-check through your executor's environment to make sure everything is spelled accordingly.
